# Acuitas Issues Tracker

This is where issues with the Acuitas Trading Bot(https://www.acuitas.app) will be submitted and tracked. This is open to license holders.

How to file issues:

1. NEVER PROVIDE LICENSE INFO OR ANY TYPE OF EXCHANGE API KEY. NO ONE FROM ACUITAS WILL EVER ASK FOR THAT PUBLICLY ON THIS REPO.
2. Provide a useful description of the problem, what you expected, and what you saw happen. Screenshots are welcome, but again, make sure they don't have any license or api info in them.
3. Be patient and try to answer any followup questions in a timely manner. The devs are quite busy and sometimes might not reply immediately.

*This repo is not meant for sales questions.* You can direct those to the official Acuitas Discord group: https://discord.gg/k9Zrhmt

Any spam or non-Acuitas related issues will be deleted.

Changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/aqs-base/acuitas-issues/blob/master/Changelog.md).
